# StarWars
React Native App

This is my first app with this technology and I did it to pass a second interview job 

The test they asked me to do was:

## React-Native app, that does the following:

+ List of all the characters of Starwars(by name) in a overview, with the picture next to it
+ Detail page of a specific character when clicking on that character so we can see:
	+ Birth Year
	+ Gender
	+ Clickable link to the homeward
+ Be able to navigate back to the overview
+ Add some simple styling(be creative! Whatever you want is nice 

You can use the API of Starwars, over here:
